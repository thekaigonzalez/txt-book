txt-book returns logical classes based on simple text-based documentation.

how it works:
    this file right now is a simple text-based documentation,
    meaning it indirectly contains headers, sections, paragraphs, etc.

    for example, to access any given information in this file, simply view the
    TBook() class.

            TBook t;
            t_read(&t, "README"); 

            writefln("the text file's contents: %s\n", t.title);

            foreach (TParagraph p; t_paragraphs(&t)) {
                writefln("%s\n", p.content()); // this file ... \n for example ...
            }

            foreach (TSection s; t_sections(&t)) {
                writefln("title: %s\n", s.title());
                writefln("%s\n", s.content()); this file...
            }

    this library also allow use of MANUAL book creation using the given structs.
